#Product Purchase Prediction Model

This repository contains a Product Purchase Prediction Model built using a Decision Tree Classification algorithm. The model predicts whether a customer will purchase a product based on various features such as user behavior and demographics.

#Overview

The goal of this project is to predict product purchases using customer data. The Decision Tree Classification algorithm was chosen due to its interpretability and efficiency.

#Dataset

The dataset used for this model consists of customer attributes like age and salary.
The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and create the training/test splits.

#Model

Algorithm: Decision Tree Classification
Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy and confustion matrix are used to evaluate the model.


#Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone git clone https://github.com/singhsrj/social-media-ads.git
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt



Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 91% on the test set.
