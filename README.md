# 📊 AdInsights AI

This repository contains a **AdInsights AI** built using a **Decision Tree Classification** algorithm. The model predicts whether a customer will purchase a product based on features like user behavior and demographics.

## 🌟 Overview

The goal of this project is to **predict product purchases** using customer data. The **Decision Tree Classification** algorithm was chosen for its **interpretability** and **efficiency**.

## 📁 Dataset

- The dataset includes customer attributes such as **age** and **salary**.
- Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, normalizing features, and creating **training/test splits**.

## 🧠 Model

- **Algorithm**: Decision Tree Classification 🌳
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using metrics like **accuracy** and the **confusion matrix**.
